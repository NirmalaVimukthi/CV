Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer position at [Company] , as advertised. With over five years of hands-on experience in software development, particularly with PHP MVC frameworks like Laravel and CodeIgniter, and recent expertise in Node.js frameworks and libraries such as React.js, Vue.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your development team.

My career began in 2019 at NIT Sistems (Pvt) Ltd, where I developed proficiency in PHP Laravel for backend and frontend applications. Later, I worked at Salelanka (Pvt) Ltd on SaaS applications, specifically inventory systems. At Ceylon Networks & Enterprise Solutions (Pvt) Ltd, I played a key role in converting multiple legacy systems to Laravel while developing mobile applications using Android Studio and Flutter. My promotion to software engineer in January 2023 is a testament to my dedication and expertise, especially in building complex authentication systems and handling large-scale projects for diverse industries like logistics, gem trading, and food production.

In addition to my backend experience, I have been committed to broadening my skills in modern JavaScript frameworks, taking the last few months to dive deep into Node.js, React.js, and other related technologies. This transition equips me with a well-rounded understanding of both server-side and client-side development, allowing me to offer versatile solutions for web, mobile, and API-based applications.

I am excited about the opportunity to join [Company] and contribute to its ongoing success by leveraging my strong foundation in PHP, Laravel, and the latest JavaScript frameworks. I am confident that my mix of experience, technical skills, and eagerness to learn will allow me to thrive in this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills align with your companyâ€™s needs.

Sincerely,
Nirmala
